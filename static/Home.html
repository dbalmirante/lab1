			<p>The closest thing to a revolutionary step the genre has ever taken. Through a series of subtle and artistic design decisions, Half-Life creates a reality that is self-contained, believable, and thoroughly engaging.</p>

			<p>Classic is launching on August 27th for anyone with a WoW subscription and closed beta testing begins for a select few on May 15th. I was lucky enough to get my hands on a prefabricated level 40 character at a preview event in Irvine, California. The ensuing hours of laughter and high jinks reassured me that WoW Classic has much more to offer than just nostalgia.
WoW Classic is a faithful recreation of the illustrious MMO as it existed in patch 1.12 . There are a few modern amenities like a somewhat enhanced suite of graphics options, modern server architecture, and access to Battle.net social features but otherwise what’s here is as true as possible to the more-than-decade-old source material. </p>
		    <p>From a graphical and technical fidelity standpoint, there can be no question that retail WoW is superior. The combat is flashier, boss mechanics are more pronounced, and the quests more intricate. Battle for Azeroth is refined, polished, and soon to be brimming with new, worthwhile multiplayer content like the Azshara’s Eternal Palace raid revealed in a recent stream. But in spite of these factors World of Warcraft Classic is far and away more desirable as an MMO to me in 2019.
Simply put, WoW Classic gives you both more reasons and opportunities to have meaningful interactions with other players. The world is filled to the brim with abstruse and challenging elements that coerce you to make and maintain relationships with others if you want to succeed. This multiplayer-first motif is evident in class design, where a low-level Warrior must enlist the aid of a healer to survive the most basic of combat encounters. It’s evident in traversal where lengthy travel times can be reduced by a Mage’s portal or Warlock’s summoning ritual. But most of all, it’s evident in the unified single-shard ecosystem where your experience is directly affected by the choices of other players. </p>

			<p> The more intricate the rat maze, the more necessary the reward -- part of Portal's sinister genius lies in the cheese-crumb trail it leaves. Puzzle solving is an end in itself, and the game's Skinner boxes (note that, like the computer intelligence pulling our strings, Valve remotely tracks player progress, indirectly seeing what stumps us) are supremely entertaining to crack in on-again-off-again sessions.</p>
